===How to install the http-representations Spring Roo Addon===

_*Note*: The Roo 1.1.0.M1 shell within the [http://www.springsource.com/products/springsource-google-download STS 2.3.3.M1] executes the *osgi* commands without showing the output. 
Additionally the shell cache directory is removed every time the shell is re-started. So you would need to re-install the addons every time you re-open the shell. 
Until these issues get resolved you may consider using the stand-alone Roo shell instead_

 * Get the latest http-representations addon: 
  [http://spring-roo-addons.googlecode.com/files/net.tzolov.httprepresentations.roo.addon-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar]
 * Install the addon via the Roo shell
{{{
  roo> felix shell start file:/<absolute path to the addon directory>/net.tzolov.httprepresentations.roo.addon-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
}}}
  (_Note: You could skip above steps and install the addon directly from the googlecode site:_
{{{ 
roo> felix shell start http://spring-roo-addons.googlecode.com/files/net.tzolov.httprepresentations.roo.addon-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 
}}}
 * Verify the installation:
{{{
  roo> osgi ps 
}}}
 * You should see something like:
{{{
...
[  60] [Active     ] [    1] net.tzolov.httprepresentations.roo.addon (1.1.0.SNAPSHOT)
}}}
 * From the Roo Shell type *help* to see the list of all supported commands. The following line should appear amongst others entries:
{{{
...
http resource add oxm - Define a class for object to xml mapping response
http resource representation setup - Install HTTP Content Negotiation Resolver into your project
}}}
