#summary (Deprecated - Roo 1.1.0.M1 only) - How to to install the jaxb-addon in your Roo shell.

=== *Deprecated - Roo 1.1.0.M1 only* How to install jaxb-addon Spring Roo Addon===

_*Note*: The Roo 1.1.0.M1 shell within the [http://www.springsource.com/products/springsource-google-download STS 2.3.3.M1] executes the *osgi* commands without showing the output. 
Additionally the shell cache directory is removed every time the shell is re-started. So you would need to re-install the addons every time you re-open the shell. 
Until these issues get resolved you may consider using the stand-alone Roo shell instead_

_*Note*: Spring Roo 1.1.0.M1 can not handle *project-info.java* files in the project source folders due to [http://jira.springframework.org/browse/ROO-1022 ROO-1022]. On the other hand the project-info.java is expected output for the Jaxb to generate process. So if the generated source code is located on the project source path (e.g. src/main/java for example) you may consider trying the following workaround:_
{{{
 roo> osgi update --bundleSymbolicName org.springframework.roo.classpath 
                  --url  http://spring-roo-addons.googlecode.com/files/org.springframework.roo.classpath-1.1.0.M1-patched-tzolov.jar
}}}
_This workaround works only with the standalone Roo shell. Make sure to restart the shell after the update for the fix to be applied_

=== Installation instructions ===
 * Install the addon directly from the googlecode site
{{{ 
  roo> felix shell start http://spring-roo-addons.googlecode.com/files/net.tzolov.jaxb.roo.addon-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 
}}}
  Alternatively you can download the [http://spring-roo-addons.googlecode.com/files/net.tzolov.jaxb.roo.addon-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar jaxb.roo.addon] and install it from your local folder:
{{{
  roo> felix shell start file:/<absolute path to the addon directory>/net.tzolov.jaxb.roo.addon-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
}}}
 * Verify the installation:
{{{
  roo> osgi ps 
}}}
 * You should see something like:
{{{
...
[  60] [Active     ] [    1] net.tzolov.jaxb.roo.addon (1.1.0.SNAPSHOT)
}}}
 * From the Roo Shell type *help* to see the list of all supported commands. The following line should appear amongst others entries:
{{{
...
jaxb xsd compiler setup - Install JAXB2 maven plugin to generate Java classes from an XML schema with the xjc schema compiler tool.
}}}
