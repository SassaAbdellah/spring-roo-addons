===How to install the http-representations Spring Roo Addon===

_*Note*: The Roo 1.1.0.M2 shell within the [http://www.springsource.com/products/springsource-google-download STS 2.3.3.M2] executes the *osgi* commands without showing the output. 
Additionally the shell cache directory is removed every time the shell is re-started. So you would need to re-install the addons every time you re-open the shell. 
Until these issues get resolved you may consider using the stand-alone Roo shell instead_

 * Uninstall the older addon versions
{{{
  roo> osgi uninstall --bundleSymbolicName net.tzolov.httprepresentations.roo.addon
}}}
 * Install the addon directly from the googlecode site:
{{{ 
roo> felix shell start http://spring-roo-addons.googlecode.com/files/net.tzolov.httprepresentations.roo.addon-1.1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 
}}}
   or download the [http://code.google.com/p/spring-roo-addons/downloads/detail?name=net.tzolov.httprepresentations.roo.addon-1.1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar httprepresentations.roo.addon] and install it locally:
{{{
  roo> felix shell start file:/<absolute path>/net.tzolov.httprepresentations.roo.addon-1.1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
}}}

 * Verify the installation:
{{{
  roo> osgi ps 
}}}
 * You should see something like:
{{{
...
[  60] [Active     ] [    1] net.tzolov.httprepresentations.roo.addon (1.1.1.SNAPSHOT)
}}}
 * From the Roo Shell type *help* to see the list of all supported commands. The following line should appear amongst others entries:
{{{
...
http resource add oxm - Define a class for object to xml mapping response
http resource representation setup - Install HTTP Content Negotiation Resolver into your project
}}}
