== How to use the jax-addon ==

Run from the Roo shell:
{{{
roo>jaxb xsd compiler setup
}}}	
Optional parameters:
 * *generateDirectory* -  Target directory for the generated code, target/generated-sources/xjc by default 
 * *schemaDirectory*   -  Specifies the schema directory, src/main/resources by default

Drop your XSD files in the schema directory (src/main/resources by default) and re-build the project. All jaxb binding classes will be generated in the generate directory (by default target/generated-sources/xjc)
