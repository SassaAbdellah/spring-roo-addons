===How to install jaxb-addon Spring Roo Addon===

_*Note*: The Roo 1.1.0.M2 shell within the [http://www.springsource.com/products/springsource-google-download STS 2.3.3.M2] executes the *osgi* commands without showing the output. 
Additionally the shell cache directory is removed every time the shell is re-started. So you would need to re-install the addons every time you re-open the shell. 
Until these issues get resolved you may consider using the stand-alone Roo shell instead_

=== Installation instructions ===
 * Install the addon directly from the googlecode site
{{{ 
  roo> felix shell start http://spring-roo-addons.googlecode.com/files/net.tzolov.jaxb.roo.addon-1.1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 
}}}
  Alternatively you can download the [http://spring-roo-addons.googlecode.com/files/net.tzolov.jaxb.roo.addon-1.1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar jaxb.roo.addon] and install it from your local folder:
{{{
  roo> felix shell start file:/<absolute path>/net.tzolov.jaxb.roo.addon-1.1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
}}}
 * Verify the installation:
{{{
  roo> osgi ps 
}}}
 * You should see something like:
{{{
...
[  60] [Active     ] [    1] net.tzolov.jaxb.roo.addon (1.1.1.SNAPSHOT)
}}}
 * From the Roo Shell type *help* to see the list of all supported commands. The following line should appear amongst others entries:
{{{
